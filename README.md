Mechamancer is a collection of scripts designed to automate and enhance various mechanical tasks. Whether you're a hobbyist or a professional, these scripts can help streamline your workflow.

```

## Usage

Each script in the collection has its own specific purpose. Below are examples of how to run some of the scripts:

### Script 1: `mechm-t-git.sh`

This script is used to automate git commands. It can be used to add, commit, and push changes to a remote repository. To run the script, follow the steps below: (Termux only)

```bash
chmod +x termux/mechm-t-git.sh

./termux/mechm-t-git.sh
```

## NOTE

Some scripts may require you do mark them as executable on some devices before running them. You can do this by running `chmod +x script_name.sh` or run our install script `chmod +x install.sh` in the terminal.

## WARNING

Don't run scripts in termux on your windows, linux, or mac terminal. They are meant to be run on termux only. This applies to all of the other scripts that can be found.
